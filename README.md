All identifiers are public by default   
Dart does not have keywords like public, private or protected    

 All Dart classes have a toString() method that you can override to provide more useful output.    

 The @override annotation tells the analyzer that you are intentionally overriding a member    

 Dart supports single or double quotes when specifying strings.     
 Use string interpolation ($variableName or ${expression}) to insert a string equivalent into a string literal.    

 Shorten one-line functions or methods using fat arrow (=>) notation.     


 To mark a Dart identifier as private, start its name with an underscore ( _ ). You can convert speed to read-only by changing its name and adding a getter.    

 By default, Dart provides implicit getters and setters for all public instance variables. You only need to define getters/setters when you want to enforce read-only or write-only variables, compute or verify a value, or update a value elsewhere.     


Optional parameters instead of function overloading  
optional parameters are enclosed inside curly braces {}    



  In object-oriented programming (OOP), a factory is an object for creating other objects â€“ formally a factory is a function or method that returns objects of a varying prototype or class[1] from some method call, which is assumed to be "new".
