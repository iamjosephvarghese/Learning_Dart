# Learning_Dart

All identifiers are public by default   
Dart does not have keywords like public, private or protected    

 All Dart classes have a toString() method that you can override to provide more useful output.    

 The @override annotation tells the analyzer that you are intentionally overriding a member    

 Dart supports single or double quotes when specifying strings.     
 Use string interpolation ($variableName or ${expression}) to insert a string equivalent into a string literal.    

 Shorten one-line functions or methods using fat arrow (=>) notation.     


 To mark a Dart identifier as private, start its name with an underscore ( _ ). You can convert speed to read-only by changing its name and adding a getter.
